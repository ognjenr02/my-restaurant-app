**README for React Native and Expo Project**

Welcome to our React Native project using Expo! This project leverages the power of Expo to create universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with React and JavaScript.

**What is Expo?**

Expo is an open-source platform that simplifies the process of building native apps. It provides a universal runtime and libraries, allowing you to write your app once and run it everywhere. The Expo client software includes client apps, modules, apps, CLI, and more. Additionally, Expo Application Services (EAS) offers a suite of hosted services that integrate deeply with Expo tools to help you build, ship, and iterate on your apps efficiently, whether you're working alone or as part of a team.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, you can install Expo CLI globally using npm:

npm install -g expo-cli


Or with yarn:

yarn global add expo-cli


After installing Expo CLI, you can create a new React Native app with support for iOS, Android, and web by running:

npx create-react-native-app


This project comes preconfigured with support for Expo Modules, allowing you to write native modules using Swift and Kotlin. This also enables you to use any library in the Expo SDK.

**Running the App**

To run the app on your device, you can use the following commands:

npm start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here
npm run ios # requires an iOS device or macOS for the simulator
npm run android # requires an Android device or emulator


You can also open the project in the Expo app on your phone to view it. The app will reload if you make edits to your source files.

**Customization**

You can customize your app by setting the correct sdkVersion in app.json and updating the react-native, react, and expo package versions as needed. Check the versioning guide for the latest information on package version compatibility.

**Ejecting from Expo**

If you've made use of Expo APIs and need to eject to a regular React Native project, you can do so while still using the Expo APIs by ejecting to "React Native + ExpoKit." This allows you to build your own native code and continue using Expo APIs.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions to this project! Whether it's submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions, your input is valuable to us. Please read through the Expo Community Guidelines for more information on how to participate in keeping our community open and welcoming.

**Documentation**

For detailed instructions on building and deploying universal apps, refer to the official Expo documentation. It's a comprehensive guide that will help you understand the full capabilities of Expo and React Native.

Thank you for choosing to work with Expo and React Native. We're excited to see what you build!
